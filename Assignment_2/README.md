<pre>Write a C program, called SIN_validate, to validate Canadian SIN numbers stored in a file. Only Unix in-
put/output system calls can be used when reading from the file.
The input file, a text file, consists of SIN numbers, one per line. Your program should open the input file and read
the SIN numbers, one at a time as a string. For each SIN number, your program should check whether it is valid.
Then, prints to the screen, using system call write(), the SIN number followed by either VALID, or NON VALID.</pre>
